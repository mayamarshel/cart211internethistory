        If I could go back and change the history of the internet I may suggest a version where in order to even use a computer that is hooked up to a net you must first create an account that is linked to your unique identity. Therefore you can only have one account and it is public record who is posting what. This would indeed change what made an anonymous software like ‘Request for Comment’ so influential, there by changing the entire way the internet is used today. It may be able to place more accountability on individuals and create a more safe environment for all. Places of anonymous conversation could still exist on specific forums but most forms of communication would be made to follow these rules. <br>
        
        The change would not be run by the government but by the creation of a public database that could be governmentally funded but not exclusive to officials. Funding for this project could come from community governmental services if the case was made to them that it would be beneficial to national security. It would likely be difficult to obtain since you aren’t getting funding for building a state of the art rocketlauncher-tank hybrid but it could have been do-able. <br> 
        To me the great man theory is stupid because I feel as though even if great men changed the world the men/women are completely a product of the community and environment they come from. If a seemingly small technological change such as identity verification could have changed the entire history of the internet, theres no way just a series of great men decided current civiliation.

        I would first set out a research team to establish a set of a few dozen local businesses which meet a few criteria: 1. Already have a strong local customer base, 2. Are located in areas spread around the country in order to ensure equal connection, and 3. Have the infrastructure to support a large influx of people and possess a router. We would then establish routers in each local business and train a few citizens on the proper management of the routers. We could hire a few people from the neighboring country to educate a few citizens on installation and management as well. This would likely have to take the form of a governmentally owned business which would hire and train workers. The business would make money by charging a small flat rate for everyone (like with universal health care) and in turn ensure that everyone who applied for service would get it (like MotherBoard did). 
        The internet service would be separate from the southern country’s service but would not be banned. Citizens would possess the ability to connect to the neighboring websites but would initially go through the local networks. This would be mutually beneficial so would not be expensive as the neighboring country could advertise to our citizens.
