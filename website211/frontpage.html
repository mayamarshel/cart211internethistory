        If I could go back and change the history of the internet I may suggest a version where in order to even use a computer that is hooked up to a net you must first create an account that is linked to your unique identity. Therefore you can only have one account and it is public record who is posting what. This would indeed change what made an anonymous software like ‘Request for Comment’ so influential, there by changing the entire way the internet is used today. It may be able to place more accountability on individuals and create a more safe environment for all. Places of anonymous conversation could still exist on specific forums but most forms of communication would be made to follow these rules. <br>
        
        The change would not be run by the government but by the creation of a public database that could be governmentally funded but not exclusive to officials. Funding for this project could come from community governmental services if the case was made to them that it would be beneficial to national security. It would likely be difficult to obtain since you aren’t getting funding for building a state of the art rocketlauncher-tank hybrid but it could have been do-able. <br> 
        To me the great man theory is stupid because I feel as though even if great men changed the world the men/women are completely a product of the community and environment they come from. If a seemingly small technological change such as identity verification could have changed the entire history of the internet, theres no way just a series of great men decided current civiliation.
